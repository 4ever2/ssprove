## Writing packages

SSProve defines a language of *code* which can feature probabilistic sampling,
assertions, memory storing and accesses, but also external procedure import.
It is a *shallow embedding* meaning that one can inject any Coq/Gallina
expression into it by using the `ret` (standing for `return`) operation which we
will expose below.

### Raw code

The main notion of code is defined as the type `raw_code A` which represents
a program returning a value of type `A`. This type `A` is typically‚Äîbut not
limited to‚Äîof type `chUniverse`.


Before detailing how to construct them, here is a first example with no
particular meaning.

```coq
#import {sig #[0] : 'nat ‚Üí 'bool √ó 'nat } as f ;;
#import {sig #[1] : 'bool ‚Üí 'unit } as g ;;
'(b,k) ‚Üê f 0 ;;
if b then (
  g false ;;
  m ‚Üê sample uniform 2 ;;
  ret 0
)
else (
  o ‚Üê get ‚Ñì ;;
  #assert (isSome o) as oSome ;;
  let n := getSome o oSome in
  put n := Some (2 + n) ;;
  ret n
)
```
where `‚Ñì` is defined as
```coq
Definition ‚Ñì : Location := ('option 'nat ; 0).
```

It first imports two procedures with respective identifiers `0` and `1` and
types `'nat ‚Üí 'bool √ó 'bool` and `'bool ‚Üí 'unit`, calling them `f` and `g`.
We take the result of `f` (the external procedure) applied to `0` as a pair
`(b,k)` and then do a case-analysis on `b`.
In the `else` branch, we read memory location `‚Ñì`, assert that it contains a
`Some`, reusing this fact (called `oSome`) to get the value itself.
We then increment this value twice and place it back in memory before
returning the original value.

#### Return constructor `ret`
```coq
ret : ‚àÄ {A}, A ‚Üí raw_code A
```
Injects any pure value into `raw_code`.

#### Memory access

A `Location` is a pair of a type in `chUniverse` and a natural number
representing an identifier, for instance `('nat ; 12) : Location`.
One can *read* memory as follows:
```coq
x ‚Üê get ‚Ñì ;; k x
(* Or with pattern matching *)
'p ‚Üê get ‚Ñì ;; k p
```
where `k` is a continuation, *i.e.* raw code which can depend on `x`.
One can *write* to a memory location as follows:
```coq
put ‚Ñì := v ;; k
```
where `v` is a value of the right type and `k` a continuation, which this time
doesn't expect any value from the writing.

#### Probabilistic sampling
```coq
x ‚Üê sample op ;; k x
(* Or alternatively *)
x <$ op ;; k x
(* Or with pattern matching *)
'p ‚Üê sample op ;; k p
```
Here `op : Op` is a (sub-)distribution. See [Distributions].

#### Failure
```coq
fail : ‚àÄ {A : chUniverse}, raw_code A
```
Represents a failure in a program. It is obtained by sampling on the null
sub-distribution.

#### Assertion
```coq
#assert b as e ;; k e
(* Alternatively, if the continuation doesn't need the equality *)
#assert b ;; k
```
Assert that the boolean `b` is `true` and store an equality `e : b = true`
to be reused by the continuation.
`#assert true as e ;; k e` simplifies to `k erefl` while
`#assert false as e ;; k e` simplifies to `fail`.

#### Import
```coq
x ‚Üê op sig ‚ãÖ arg ;; k x
```
Represents application of imported/assumed procedure of signature `sig : opsig`
to argument `arg`, calling the result `x` before passing it to continuation `k`.
See [Specialised types] for how to define `sig`.
A preferred alternative to writing imports it to use the following notation
```coq
#import sig as f ;; k' f
```
where `f` bound in the continuation is a function which can be applied via bind.
For instance if `sig` is `{sig #[n] : 'nat ‚Üí 'bool √ó 'bool }` then
`f` has type `nat ‚Üí raw_code (bool * bool)` and can be used as
```
x ‚Üê f arg ;; k x
```

#### Bind
`raw_code` is a monad and as such it supports a *bind* operator. With value
reuse it can be written as follows:
```coq
x ‚Üê v ;; k x
(* Or with pattern matching *)
'p ‚Üê v ;; k p
```
and without, as
```coq
v ;; k
```
This operation is not a primitive/constructor and will reduce to the above
constructions when `v` is concrete.

### Specialised types

We have a special type called `chUniverse` which contains *codes* for specific
types that we use in our packages. These are the types used in `Location`
and in `opsig` or even in `Op`.

To differentiate them from actual types while retaining some familiarity
we usually style them with a quotation mark in front of the type they represent.
This is the case for instance of `'nat`, `'bool`, `'unit` and `'option` which
are self-explanatory.

We also provide `'fin n` which is the *inhabited* finite type of size `n`.
Under the hood, Coq will attempt to prove that `n` is non-zero.
In case it fails, the user should provide instances or hints for the
`Positive` type-class.

We also have the product type `chProd x y` which is interpreted to Coq's
product `prod`. For instance `chProd 'nat 'bool` corresponds to `nat * bool`.

Finally we have the type of finite maps `chMap x y` where `x` is the type of
keys, and `y` the type of values.

#### Further notation in specific settings

When defining signatures (`opsig`), interfaces (see [Valid code]), or packages
(see [Packages]), one can further use handy notations for `chProd` and
`chMap`, as exemplified below:

```coq
'nat √ó 'bool
{map 'nat ‚Üí 'option 'nat }
```

#### Signatures

A signature (`opsig`) is given by an identifier (a natural number), an
argument type and a return type (both in `chUniverse`).
Once can for instance write `(37, ('nat, chProd 'unit 'unit))`.

We provide the following nicer notation:
```coq
{sig #[37] : 'nat ‚Üí 'unit √ó 'unit }
```

### Distributions

The user can sample using pretty much any distribution that can be expressed
in `mathcomp-analysis` provided that its support is in `chUniverse`.
Writing them by hand might not be very convenient.

For the time being we provide `uniform n` which represents a uniform
distribution landing in `'fin n`. As such `n` must be positive
(Coq will look for an instance of `Positive n`).

### Valid code

[Raw code] as described above is well-typed but does not have any guarantees
with respect to what it imports and which location it uses. We therefore
define a notion a validity with respect to an import interface and a set of
locations.

#### Set of locations

The set of locations is expected as an `{fset Location }` using the finite
sets of the [extructures] library. For our purposes, it is advisable to write
them directly as list which of locations which is then cast to an `fset` using
the `fset` operation, as below:
```coq
fset [:: ‚Ñì‚ÇÄ ; ‚Ñì‚ÇÅ ; ‚Ñì‚ÇÇ ]
```
This is the best way to leverage the automation that we introduced.
Nevertheless, in some cases it might be more convenient to use the union
(`:|:`) operator of [extructures].

#### Interfaces

An interface is a set of signatures (`opsig`) corresponding to the procedures
that a piece of code *can* import and use.
Rather than writing them as `fset` directly, we provide special convenient
notations, as well the type `Interface`.

Interfaces are wrapped in the `[interface]` container which behaves like lists.
They are of the form
```coq
[interface d‚ÇÄ ; d‚ÇÅ ; ‚Ä¶ ; d‚Çô ]
```
where the `d·µ¢` are signatures, given using a special syntax:
```coq
val #[ id ] : src ‚Üí tgt
```
where `id` is a natural number / identifier, and `src` and `tgt` are codes of
types in `chUniverse` given using the special syntax (see [Specialised types]).

Here are examples of interfaces:
```coq
[interface]
```

```coq
[interface
  val #[ 0 ] : 'nat ‚Üí 'nat ;
  val #[ 1 ] : 'option 'bool ‚Üí 'unit √ó {map 'nat ‚Üí 'bool }
]
```

#### Validity of code

Validity of code `c` with respect to set of locations `L` and import interface
`I` is denoted by the class `ValidCode L I c`.
We derive from it the type `code L I A` of valid code.

Raw code `c` can be cast to `code` by using the notation
```coq
{code c }
```

For instance, in the following, we declare a simple `code` by just giving
the `raw_code` and using the `{code}` notation:
```coq
Definition foo : code fset0 [interface] bool :=
  {code ret true }.
```

The fact that this is a class means that in practice, the validity proof
should automatically be inferred by Coq.
In case where automation doesn't work, it is still possible to leverage it to
find which sub-goal it did not solve for you by using the `ssprove_valid`
tactic.

Here is an example using `Equations` that allows us to use the proof mode to
fill in the validity proof.
```coq
Obligation Tactic := idtac.

Definition ‚Ñì : Location := ('nat ; 0).

Equations? foo : code fset0 [interface] 'nat :=
  foo := {code
    n ‚Üê get ‚Ñì ;;
    ret n
  }.
Proof.
  ssprove_valid.
  (* We have to prove ‚Ñì \in fset0 which does not hold. *)
Abort.
```
We can then see where the mistake was and change the empty interface to
something containing `‚Ñì` like `fset [:: ‚Ñì ]`.

Note that `ssprove_valid` and the inference for `ValidCode` can be extended
with hints. The former using the `packages` database, the latter with the
`typeclass_instances` database.

**Note:** There is an implicit coercion from `code` to `raw_code`.

### Packages

#### Package construction

We have a notion of `raw_package` which is a collection of procedures of the
form `src ‚Üí raw_code tgt` distinguished by their signatures. This notion of
`raw_package` will prove the most efficient when proving results about packages,
such as advantages.
However, we provide a syntax to define valid packages by construction, *i.e.*
of type `package L I E` where each procedure must be `ValidCode L I tgt` and
the lot of them must implement export interface `E`.

The syntax for valid packages is similar to that of interfaces. Better explained
on an example:

```coq
Definition test :
  package
    fset0
    [interface
      val #[0] : 'nat ‚Üí 'bool ;
      val #[1] : 'bool ‚Üí 'unit
    ]
    [interface
      val #[2] : 'nat ‚Üí 'nat ;
      val #[3] : 'bool √ó 'bool ‚Üí 'bool
    ]
  :=
  [package
    def #[2] (n : 'nat) : 'nat {
      #import {sig #[0] : 'nat ‚Üí 'bool } as f ;;
      #import {sig #[1] : 'bool ‚Üí 'unit } as g ;;
      b ‚Üê f n ;;
      if b then
        g false ;;
        ret 0
      else ret n
    } ;
    def #[3] ('(b‚ÇÄ,b‚ÇÅ) : 'bool √ó 'bool) : 'bool {
      ret b‚ÇÄ
    }
  ].
```

Packages are wrapped in the `[package]` container which behaves like lists.
They are of the form
```coq
[package d‚ÇÄ ; d‚ÇÅ ; ‚Ä¶ ; d‚Çô ]
```
where the `d·µ¢` are declarations, given using a special syntax:
```coq
def #[ id ] (x : src) : tgt { e }
```
where `id` is a natural number / identifier, and `src` and `tgt` are codes of
types in `chUniverse` given using the special syntax (see [Specialised types]),
while `e` is a regular Coq expression corresponding to the body of the function,
with `x` bound inside it.
As seen in the example, `x` can be matched against in the declaration by using
the `'p` notation where `p` is a pattern.

Similarly to `ValidCode`, there is an underlying `ValidPackage` class and we can
call its best effort version with `ssprove_valid`, for instance using
`Equations` (see [Valid code]).

In the example above we also explicitly gave an export interface while the
information is already present in the declaration. As such in can be omitted
as on the simpler example below:
```coq
Definition test' : package fset0 [interface] _ :=
  [package
    def #[ 0 ] (n : 'nat) : 'nat {
      ret (n + n)%N
    } ;
    def #[ 1 ] (b : 'bool) : 'nat {
      if b then ret 0 else ret 13
    }
  ].
```
The locations and import interface should however be given explicitly since
they are what the programs *can* use, not what they *exactly* use.

#### Composition of packages

One of the key points of SSP is its package algebra with sequential and parallel
composition as well as the identity package. All these operations are defined on
`raw_packages` directly but extend to `package` with the `{package}` and
`{locpackage}` notations.

Sequential composition is called `link` in SSProve and can be written
`p‚ÇÄ ‚àò p‚ÇÅ`. It represents `p‚ÇÄ` where all *imports* are replaced by the inlined
procedures of `p‚ÇÅ`. It is valid when the export interface of `p‚ÇÅ` matches the
import interface of `p‚ÇÄ`.

Parallel composition of (raw) packages `p‚ÇÄ` and `p‚ÇÅ` is written `par p‚ÇÄ p‚ÇÅ`.
It is valid if we have `Parable p‚ÇÄ p‚ÇÅ` (which is a class).
The resulting package must have the union of locations of its components, as
such automation can be lacking on that front, so it might be a good idea to rely
on `Equations` again:
```coq
Equations? pkg : package L I E :=
  pkg := {package (par p‚ÇÄ p‚ÇÅ) ‚àò p‚ÇÇ }.
Proof.
  ssprove_valid.
  (* Now deal with the goals *)
```

Finally the identity package is defined as `ID I` where `I` is an interface.
It both imports and exports `I` by simply forwarding the calls.
It is valid as long as `I` does not include two signatures sharing the same
identifier, as overloading is not possible in our packages. This property is
written `flat I` and can be inferred automatically by `ssprove_ valid`.

As illustrated above, `{package p }` casts a raw package to some
`package L I E`, trying to infer the proof. We also have `{locpackage p }`
which will cast to `loc_package I E` which is essentially the same as `package`
but where the set of locations is internalised.

**Note:** `loc_package` and `package` both have implicit coercions to
`raw_package`. This means that, for instance, if `p‚ÇÄ` and `p‚ÇÅ` are both
`package` then, `{package p‚ÇÄ ‚àò p‚ÇÅ }` is a valid expression, and will be complete
if the interfaces match.
