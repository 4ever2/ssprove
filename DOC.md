## Writing packages

SSProve defines a language of *code* which can feature probabilistic sampling,
assertions, memory storing and accesses, but also external procedure import.
It is a *shallow embedding* meaning that one can inject any Coq/Gallina
expression into it by using the `ret` (standing for `return`) operation which we
will expose below.

### Raw code

The main notion of code is defined as the type `raw_code A` which represents
a program returning a value of type `A`. This type `A` is typically‚Äîbut not
limited to‚Äîof type `chUniverse`.


Before detailing how to construct them, here is a first example with no
particular meaning.

```coq
#import {sig #[0] : 'nat ‚Üí 'bool √ó 'nat } as f ;;
#import {sig #[1] : 'bool ‚Üí 'unit } as g ;;
'(b,k) ‚Üê f 0 ;;
if b then (
  g false ;;
  m ‚Üê sample uniform 2 ;;
  ret 0
)
else (
  o ‚Üê get ‚Ñì ;;
  #assert (isSome o) as oSome ;;
  let n := getSome o oSome in
  put n := Some (2 + n) ;;
  ret n
)
```
where `‚Ñì` is defined as
```coq
Definition ‚Ñì : Location := ('option 'nat ; 0).
```

It first imports two procedures with respective identifiers `0` and `1` and
types `'nat ‚Üí 'bool √ó 'bool` and `'bool ‚Üí 'unit`, calling them `f` and `g`.
We take the result of `f` (the external procedure) applied to `0` as a pair
`(b,k)` and then do a case-analysis on `b`.
In the `else` branch, we read memory location `‚Ñì`, assert that it contains a
`Some`, reusing this fact (called `oSome`) to get the value itself.
We then increment this value twice and place it back in memory before
returning the original value.

#### Return constructor `ret`
```coq
ret : ‚àÄ {A}, A ‚Üí raw_code A
```
Injects any pure value into `raw_code`.

#### Memory access

A `Location` is a pair of a type in `chUniverse` and a natural number
representing an identifier, for instance `('nat ; 12) : Location`.
One can *read* memory as follows:
```coq
x ‚Üê get ‚Ñì ;; k x
(* Or with pattern matching *)
'p ‚Üê get ‚Ñì ;; k p
```
where `k` is a continuation, *i.e.* raw code which can depend on `x`.
One can *write* to a memory location as follows:
```coq
put ‚Ñì := v ;; k
```
where `v` is a value of the right type and `k` a continuation, which this time
doesn't expect any value from the writing.

#### Probabilistic sampling
```coq
x ‚Üê sample op ;; k x
(* Or alternatively *)
x <$ op ;; k x
(* Or with pattern matching *)
'p ‚Üê sample op ;; k p
```
Here `op : Op` is a (sub-)distribution. See [Distributions].

#### Failure
```coq
fail : ‚àÄ {A : chUniverse}, raw_code A
```
Represents a failure in a program. It is obtained by sampling on the null
sub-distribution.

#### Assertion
```coq
#assert b as e ;; k e
(* Alternatively, if the continuation doesn't need the equality *)
#assert b ;; k
```
Assert that the boolean `b` is `true` and store an equality `e : b = true`
to be reused by the continuation.
`#assert true as e ;; k e` simplifies to `k erefl` while
`#assert false as e ;; k e` simplifies to `fail`.

#### Import
```coq
x ‚Üê op sig ‚ãÖ arg ;; k x
```
Represents application of imported/assumed procedure of signature `sig : opsig`
to argument `arg`, calling the result `x` before passing it to continuation `k`.
See [Specialised types] for how to define `sig`.
A preferred alternative to writing imports it to use the following notation
```coq
#import sig as f ;; k' f
```
where `f` bound in the continuation is a function which can be applied via bind.
For instance if `sig` is `{sig #[n] : 'nat ‚Üí 'bool √ó 'bool }` then
`f` has type `nat ‚Üí raw_code (bool * bool)` and can be used as
```
x ‚Üê f arg ;; k x
```

#### Bind
`raw_code` is a monad and as such it supports a *bind* operator. With value
reuse it can be written as follows:
```coq
x ‚Üê v ;; k x
(* Or with pattern matching *)
'p ‚Üê v ;; k p
```
and without, as
```coq
v ;; k
```
This operation is not a primitive/constructor and will reduce to the above
constructions when `v` is concrete.

### Specialised types

We have a special type called `chUniverse` which contains *codes* for specific
types that we use in our packages. These are the types used in `Location`
and in `opsig` or even in `Op`.

To differentiate them from actual types while retaining some familiarity
we usually style them with a quotation mark in front of the type they represent.
This is the case for instance of `'nat`, `'bool`, `'unit` and `'option` which
are self-explanatory.

We also provide `'fin n` which is the *inhabited* finite type of size `n`.
Under the hood, Coq will attempt to prove that `n` is non-zero.
In case it fails, the user should provide instances or hints for the
`Positive` type-class.

We also have the product type `chProd x y` which is interpreted to Coq's
product `prod`. For instance `chProd 'nat 'bool` corresponds to `nat * bool`.

Finally we have the type of finite maps `chMap x y` where `x` is the type of
keys, and `y` the type of values.

#### Further notation in specific settings

When defining signatures (`opsig`), interfaces (see [Valid code]), or packages
(see [Packages]), one can further use handy notations for `chProd` and
`chMap`, as exemplified below:

```coq
'nat √ó 'bool
{map 'nat ‚Üí 'option 'nat }
```

#### Signatures

A signature (`opsig`) is given by an identifier (a natural number), an
argument type and a return type (both in `chUniverse`).
Once can for instance write `(37, ('nat, chProd 'unit 'unit))`.

We provide the following nicer notation:
```coq
{sig #[37] : 'nat ‚Üí 'unit √ó 'unit }
```

### Distributions

The user can sample using pretty much any distribution that can be expressed
in `mathcomp-analysis` provided that its support is in `chUniverse`.
Writing them by hand might not be very convenient.

For the time being we provide `uniform n` which represents a uniform
distribution landing in `'fin n`. As such `n` must be positive
(Coq will look for an instance of `Positive n`).

### Valid code

[Raw code] as described above is well-typed but does not have any guarantees
with respect to what it imports and which location it uses. We therefore
define a notion a validity with respect to an import interface and a set of
locations.

#### Set of locations

The set of locations is expected as an `{fset Location }` using the finite
sets of the [extructures] library. For our purposes, it is advisable to write
them directly as list which of locations which is then cast to an `fset` using
the `fset` operation, as below:
```coq
fset [:: ‚Ñì‚ÇÄ ; ‚Ñì‚ÇÅ ; ‚Ñì‚ÇÇ ]
```
This is the best way to leverage the automation that we introduced.
Nevertheless, in some cases it might be more convenient to use the union
(`:|:`) operator of [extructures].

#### Interfaces

An interface is a set of signatures (`opsig`) corresponding to the procedures
that a piece of code *can* import and use.
Rather than writing them as `fset` directly, we provide special convenient
notations, as well the type `Interface`.

Interfaces are wrapped in the `[interface]` container which behaves like lists.
They are of the form
```coq
[interface d‚ÇÄ ; d‚ÇÅ ; ‚Ä¶ ; d‚Çô ]
```
where the `d·µ¢` are signatures, given using a special syntax:
```coq
val #[ id ] : src ‚Üí tgt
```
where `id` is a natural number / identifier, and `src` and `tgt` are codes of
types in `chUniverse` given using the special syntax (see [Specialised types]).

Here are examples of interfaces:
```coq
[interface]
```

```coq
[interface
  val #[ 0 ] : 'nat ‚Üí 'nat ;
  val #[ 1 ] : 'option 'bool ‚Üí 'unit √ó {map 'nat ‚Üí 'bool }
]
```
